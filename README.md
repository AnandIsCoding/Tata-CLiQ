**ðŸš€ What is Auth0?**
Auth0 is an authentication-as-a-service platform.
It handles login, signup, logout, user profiles, authorization etc., so you don't have to build it manually.

----

âœ… Auth0 gives you:

Login with Email/Password
Social login (Google, Facebook, etc.)
Passwordless login
Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
Authorization (roles, permissions)
Secure token management (OAuth, OpenID Connect)
Instead of building your own login system âž” you connect your app to Auth0.
